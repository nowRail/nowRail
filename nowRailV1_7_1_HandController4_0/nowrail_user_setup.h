//WIFI added in Version 1.4.4

//-----------------------------------------------------------------
//All boards should be set to the same channel. Only use 1,6 and 11 for technical reasons
//See https://www.digitaltown.co.uk/nowRail.php#WIFI 
#define WIFICHANNEL 1 //Defaults for ESP-NOW is 1 or the Access point address if using wifi with a router

//Uncomment this line to encrypt data packets. All boards on a layout must have the same setting
//For legacy systems comment this line out
//See https://www.digitaltown.co.uk/nowRail.php#WIFI 
#define ENCRYPT  //uncomment to run encryption on broadcasts

//Uncomnenting this line will mean the board will automatically look for the MASTERCLOCK after missing 3 broadcasts.
//This allows layouts to change WIFI channel from a single command
//Layout MUST have a MASTERCLOCK running on it
//See https://www.digitaltown.co.uk/nowRail.php#WIFI 
#define WIFIMASTERCLOCKCHANGE //this allows the boards wifi channel to be changed while running

//Diagnostics----------------------------------------------------------------------
//Diagnostics shows the nowRail commands in the Serial monitor
//WARNING:DO NOT USE WHEN CONNECTED TO JMRICMRI...diagnostics will be sent to JMRI :-(
#define DIAGNOSTICS_ON    //Will display all incoming messages in Serial with DIAG> Prefix 

//MASTERCLOCK
//https://www.digitaltown.co.uk/nowRail.php#MASTERCLOCK
//Only one board should be MASTERCLOCK_ON... This really needs to be a board that is ALWAYS turned on.
//A MASTERCLOCK board is required for if WIFIMASTERCLOCKCHANGE is being used
//#define MASTERCLOCK_ON    //this board is the master clock and will send out a broadcast to sync all other boards

//SERIAL Devices.........................................
//nowRail use Serial2.... WARNING  some boards DO NOT have Serial 2
//Tested on ESP32 Dev Module... check other boards have Serial2 before using
#define SERIALRX2 16
#define SERIALTX2 17

//MP3 Player DY-SV5W, DY-HV8F, DY_HV20T, JQ8900............................
//See https://youtu.be/91_2KRJqaWs
//This sets up Serial 2 using the pins defined in SERIALRX2 and SERIALTX2
// #define MP3BUSYPIN 15  //15 is the interrupt pin that is connected to the MP3 Busy pin
// #define MP3NUMTRACKS 20 //defaults to 20 commands, increase number if more commands (accessories) are required
// #define MP3INTERVALMIN 250  //random time gaps min...WARNING times below 250 may lead to odd results as MP3 player may not react quick enough
// #define MP3INTERVALMAX 10000 //random time gaps max
// #define MP3VOLUME 27  //default volume (volumes are 0-30)

//DCC EX Serial communication.............................................
//WARNING MAke sure SERIALRX2 and SERIALTX2 are uncommented in this file just below DIAGNOSTICS_ON 
//#define DCCEXSSERIAL2_ON //best done on ESP32 Dev Module Writes DCC EX instructions to Serial 2...for Serial2 connection to DCC EX
//#define DCCEXSERIAL_ON  //best done on ESP32 Dev Module Writes DCC EX instruction to Serial ... for debugging

//NCE Cab bus..........................................................
//See https://www.digitaltown.co.uk/nowRail.php#NCE
//Accessory command range 1-2000
//#define CAB_BUS_ADDRESS 4 // This is the address on CAB BUS for the unit There are a limited number of addresses with the PowerCab
//#define CAB_BUS_SHORTADDRON 0 //Loco Addresses 1-128 will be treated as Short Addresses, set to 0 for all LONG addresses
//#define RS485ENABLLEPIN 4 //RS485 modules requires RX/TX at 9600 Baud and a transmit pin defined in this line 

//JMRI.....................................................................
//See https://youtu.be/5YLXue_GavU
//JMRI needs to connect to Serial so DIAGNOSTICS cannot be used at the same time.
//Serial needs to be configured in setup() Comment out standard setup and uncomment the JMRI serial configuration.
//#define JMRICMRI  1  //JMRICMRI connection, this uses Serial at 115200 baud rate, VALUE 1 is CMRI node number (0-127)
//#define JMRICMRINUMCARDS 24 //Number of Cards set up 24 x 8 gives 192 sensors, increase if needed

//Other DCC systems.................................................................
//See https://youtu.be/6ZjmP6hau1c
//DCC Decoder mode... reads accessory commands from any DCC system and sends them over nowRail
//#define DCCDECODERPIN 4 //If board is being used as a DCC decoder this is the interrupt pin
//#define ONEBITTIME 130  // If your DCC system does not work you can change this value. NCE systems and DCCEX seem to work between 130 - 180

//I2C Devices...........................................................

//All I2C devices need the Wire.h uncommented
#include "Wire.h"

//EEPROM...........................................................
//See https://www.digitaltown.co.uk/nowRail.php#EEPROM
//NowRail uses EEPROM to store MASTERCLOCK time if you want to restart at the same time when restarting layout
//EEPROM is also used in the loco controller to store the loco data
//just put in the default eeprom address
#define NOWDisc 0x50    //Default Address of 24LC256 eeprom chip in Board
//END EEPROM

//PCA9685..............................................
//For servos see https://youtu.be/khPnUbnIN88
//For LEDs see https://youtu.be/xKgqPWWVrK8
//used for Servos and LED's NOTE: LED's and servos CANNOT be on the same board address
//#define MAXPCA9685SERVOBOARDS 5 //default is 5, increase if required
//#define SERVOMIN 450    //servo min value
//#define SERVOMAX 2000   //servo max value


//GT911 Touch Screen.....................................................
//See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s4-Wp4rPuw
// #define GT911 0x5D  //Uncomment for gt911 touch screen
// #define GT911TOUCHBUTTONS 30  //sets the touch point buttons, increase for more buttons.
// #define GT911TOUCHRADIUS 35   //35 is approx 5mm either side of the centre touch point
